# pacman2
A far-from-perfect pacman game made with Unity and C#

INSTRUCTIONS ON MAKING THIS GAME WORK:

0. If you have admin privileges, skip step 1.

1. Obtain superuser (su) privileges

https://zwbetz.com/add-your-account-as-a-sudoer-on-mac/ <--- use this link if you get stuck

2. Once you have done that, type command in terminal:

sudo chmod -R 755 + filepath

This allows you access into the file (assuming you get the "you don't have permission to open the application" error)

3. control+click (right click) then click open (don't double click) to open while override MacOS app security protocol (won't open otherwise)

4. Select a resolution of your preference, and enjoy the game!

5. When you spend all 3 lives, the menu button stops working. Press esc to return to main menu and start a new game.
