# pacman2
A far-from-perfect pacman game made with Unity and C#

Problem: 
-High score system not completed 

INSTRUCTIONS ON MAKING THIS GAME WORK:

1. Obtain superuser (su) preferences 

2. Once you have done that, type command in terminal:

sudo chmod -R 755 + filepath

3. control+click (right click) then click open (don't double click) to open while override MacOS app security protocol (won't open otherwise)

4. Select a resolution of your preference, and enjoy the game!

5. When you die, be advised that the menu button stops working (i'm sorry). Press esc to return to main menu and start a new game.
